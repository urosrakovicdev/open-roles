// The database connection — the ONE place a Drizzle client is created.
// Everything else imports `db` from here. Marked server-only so a Client
// Component importing it (directly or transitively) becomes a build error
// (Lesson 01 / 04 — keep the DB and its credentials off the client).

// `schema` is passed so the relational query API (db.query.*) knows your tables.
