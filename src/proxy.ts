// proxy.ts — Next.js 16 middleware (was middleware.ts pre-16).
// Runs on EVERY matched request, including prefetches.
//
// LEARNING NOTE (Lesson 05): this is the OPTIMISTIC auth tier. It may only read
// the session cookie for a fast redirect — it must NOT hit the database, and it
// is NOT the security boundary. The real check is re-run in the DAL at every
// data entry point. Re-exporting Auth.js's `auth` gives us that cookie-cheap
// check for free.

// Limit where the proxy runs (skip static assets). Protect the (app) dashboard.
